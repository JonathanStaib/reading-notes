# Reading notes for Class 5

## javascript

- Javascript is on front end and backend
- YOU CAN MAKE THIngS HAPPEN
- makes the website function
- Utilizies functions but doesnt have to

- JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.
- Javascript allows interactive options such as doing math by plugging in two numbers or entering in your name
- a corner stone is Ajax rewuest for JSON data
- Creating a TODO list can be considered just a little bit further from "Hello World", the "standard" example people use when learning a new language. In this example we'll build a very basic TODO application using some HTML5 features and JavaScript. you can do this by add an input then enter the text the button will have thats clickable
- then a div elemet.. where u are going to display the current list
- then load the external JS file called todo.js
- you need to store todo in "database" then fetch it from the so called "database"
- site shows how to fetch, add, show,  and remove todo list  [Link for TODO here](https://code-maven.com/todo-in-html-and-javascript)
- LEAVE SPACES AROUND OPERATIONS

- 4 Ways to Declare a JavaScript Variable: 
1. Using var
2. Using let
3. Using const
4. Using nothing
- 
- dont use var, just use let and const
- const cant be changed
- let can be changed
- Data types, String, Boolean, Number/Integer, 
- String is words, texts, numbers inside of ' '
- Java script is single ' while html is double " 
- boolean is true/flase
number/integer is a number, reads number 4 not text 4, string reads text 4
- aiignment operations are x like algebra x = 10, doesnt equal it evaluates to, x holds 10
- let x; then x = 10;
- cannot use same vairables names twice
- === means strictly equal

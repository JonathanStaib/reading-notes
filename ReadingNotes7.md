# Reading Notes for CLass 7

## The Control Flow

- The control flow is the order in wchih the computer executes satements in a script
- A typical script in Javascript of PHP inclides many control structures, conditionals, loops and functions. You can also set when events will occur
- Control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.

## JavaScript Functions

- A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
- A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).
- Javascript functions are defined with the function keyword, follow by a name, followed by ()
- They can contain letters, digits, underscores and/or dollar signs
- The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function: When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button), When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code, Automatically (self invoked)
- The function will stop when it reaches the return. This is common and the return value will be presented back to the "customer"
- You can reuse code when it comes to functions! define it once and use it multiple times, you can produce different results with different arguments, codes

## JavaSCript Operators

- This is where numbers and lgebra come into play
- additon is +
- multiplecation is *
- assignment to say this number = this, is =
- - is subtraction
- ** is exponentian
- / is division
- ++ increment and -- decrement
- can combine things like x +=y will come out to x = x + y, etc.
- "5" + 5 will be 55 due to string operations
- == equal to, similarily 
- === is strictly equal to, exactly the same
- != not equal to
- && logical and, || logical or, ! logical not
- typeof - Returns the type of a variable
- instanceof - Returns true if an object is an instance of an object type
- i dont completely understand the Bitwise operators, definitely research more!

# My Reading Notes  Class 4
 
## Wireframe

- Wireframing is the Black and White i guess you could all rough draft
- CAn use software like Invision or Balsamiq to create wireframes, Also UXPin Wireframe.cc
- Paper and pencil is a good way to wireframe, much easier to change and visualize
- Before picking up pen and pecil first, think about your audience, detailing rewuirements, use competitor and industry research
- Must determine a Flow that you want the user to follow
- Dont think about aesthetics or colors just gert your simple ideas down first. Its a sketch not a illustration. KEEP IT SIMPLE
- Usability conventions, such as putting the navigation at the top next to your logo, having a search box on the top right, and so on
Simple, instructional wording for i.e. calls-to-action
- Have people test, whether is colleagues or anybody
- Tune your wireframe into prototypes. 
- Your wireframe needs to answer the questions of what that site page is, what the user can do there, and if it satisfies their needs. 
- Increase User confidence, Keep it simple, Too much information will confuse others and push them away. You want them to want to be there.

### Notes from Reading

- HTML is the structure of the Webpage, the bland Black and White that carries all the rest

# My Code Fellows Reading Notes!
*My Reading Notes for Code 102*

Hi my name is <span style="color:blue">***Jonathan!***</span> I like video games and anime and I collect funko pops (primarilly anime). I also much prefer html over markdown. :)

**3 Reminders to keep myself in the growth mindset:**

- Keep a positive outlook on your progress. Look at what you have achieved, not what you are struggling to!
- Don't stress yourself on not being able to solve a problem. Check google or Seek help!
- Be open to learn! (learning to learn)

# Notes for Terminal!

- ls is to list
- cd space ___ is to change direction
- pwd is to bring u to primary users files
- cd with nothing after will bring u to starting user
- code space . will bring u to code app that youve made
- to go backwards: cd .. for one level, cd ... for 2 levels and so on
- mkdir space ___ to make directory (make new file) (- if u want to make multiple words, no spaces)
- go to where u want to go before opening vs code unless u want a fried pc 
- ol 5 li for multiples lists

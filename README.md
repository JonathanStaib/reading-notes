*My Reading Notes for Code 102*

Hi my name is <span style="color:blue">***Jonathan!***</span> I like video games and anime and I collect funko pops (primarilly anime).

**3 Reminders to keep myself in the growth mindset:**

- Keep a positive outlook on your progress. Look at what you have achieved, not what you are struggling to!
- Don't stress yourself on not being able to solve a problem. Check google or Seek help!
- Be open to learn! (learning to learn)

# Reading Notes for Class 8

## Expressions and operators

- This goes over expressions and operators such as string, logical and more
- x = 7 is an example = is an operator it assigns x to 7
- 3 + 4 os using the + operator, const z = 3 + 4
- no matter the order or * and + it will prioritize multiplication PEMDAS 
- infix binary is 3+4 or x+y
- For more complex assignments, the destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to extract data from arrays or objects using a syntax that mirrors the construction of array and object literals.
- assignments are used within a variable declaration const,let,var 
- assignments can be chained
- Comparison operators returns a logical value based on true/false
- Arithmetic operators takes numbers and a operations and returns a number 
- false && anything is short-circuit evaluated to false
- true || anything is short-circuit evaluated to true
- 'My' + 'String' is a string and will become My String 4 + '4' will be 44
- The typeof operator returns a string indicating the type of the unevaluated operand. operand is the string, variable, keyword, or object for which the type is to be returned. The parentheses are optional
- The void operator specifies an expression to be evaluated without returning a value. expression is a JavaScript expression to evaluate. The parentheses surrounding the expression are optional, but it is good style to use them
- super will determine a classes parent!

## Loops

- Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly, which is self explanatory
- They repeat and action of some sort over and over
- The For Loop is executed once the condition expression is true
- The While statement, if the answer is false it will repeat. ex would be password login
- The continue statement can be used to restart a while, do-while, for, or label statement
- The for...of statement creates a loop invoking a custom iteration hook for each distinct property
- The for...in statement will create a different specific statement for each property
-
